# test-quizzer
just a mockup of how the quizzer will be
I made a big array of data, to look like how the data will be passed in from the backend.
once they finish the section ad the UI/UX designer said, the score will be passed to the backend and 
then a fresh http request will be made to get the next section that has been "unlocked".
